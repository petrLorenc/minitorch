# MiniTorch

The idea for this repository came after seeing [Andrej Karpathy's explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0) of his project [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd). I was trying to absorb as many ideas from his tutorial as possible and then make myself passionate about replicating similar ideas. I admit that I may have been influenced by watching his tutorial. Still, I haven't browsed the repository too much. I am also planning to avoid a sneak peek into his code to make my variation of the whole idea. My motto is: Let's surprise myself :)

### Plans

Classes to be implemented:

```python
Scalar(float)
Vector(List[Scalar])
NeuralNet(List[Vector])
```

Method/principles need to be taken into account:

```python
forward_pass -> __call__()
backward_pass -> backward()
visualize
train
```

### How to run the code
